### Data formate: 1) Each field are splited by COMMA(','); 2) Values are concatenated by DASH('-') in individual field; 3) Values number of multi-values fields should be equal to NLAYERS; 4) Just provide the fields that have values, REQUIRED fields are necessary.
### Here is a brief description of the variables adopted in SEIMS.
### Variable Name   Definition
### SEQN            (required) Sequence number of soil catogory, CAUTION: No need to be consistent with SOIL CLASS.
### NAME            (required) Soil name, CAUTION: a soil name may have multi SEQN to represent heterogeneity according to LANDUSE or SLOPE, etc.
### SOILLAYERS      (required) Soil layers number, BE AWARE that NLAYERS may be different in this lookup table.
### SOL_Z           (required, multi-values) Depth from soil surface to bottom of layer (mm), e.g., 100, 400, 800.
### SOL_OM          (required, multi-values) Organic matter content (% soil weight)
### SOL_CLAY        (required, multi-values) Clay content (% soil weight), diameter < 0.002 mm
### SOL_SILT        (required, multi-values) Silt content (% soil weight), diameter between 0.002 mm and 0.05 mm
### SOL_SAND        (required, multi-values) Sand content (% soil weight), diameter between 0.05 mm and 2 mm
### SOL_ROCK        (required, multi-values) Rock fragment content (% total weight), diameter > 2 mm
### SOL_BD          (required, multi-values) Moist bulk density (Mg/m3 or g/cm3), value should between 1.1 and 1.9
### SOL_AWC         (required, multi-values) Available water capacity
### SOL_ZMX         (optional) Maximum rooting depth of soil profile(mm)
### ANION_EXCL      (optional) Fraction of porosity (void space) from which anions are excluded, default is 0.5.
### SOL_CRK         (optional) Potential or maximum crack volume of the soil profile expressed as a fraction of the total soil volume. 
### SOL_K           (optional, multi-values) Saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm/hr)
### SOL_WP          (optional, multi-values) Wilting point
### SOL_FC          (optional, multi-values) Field capacity
### SOL_POROSITY    (optional, multi-values) Porosity
### SOL_USLE_K      (optional, multi-values) USLE K factor
### SOL_ALB         (optional) Albedo when soil is moist
### ESCO            (optional) Soil evaporation compensation factor, the default is 0.95
### SOL_NO3         (optional and can be 0, multi-values) concentration of nitrate in soil layers, g/kg
### SOL_NH4         (optional and can be 0, multi-values) concentration of ammonium-N in soil layers, g/kg
### SOL_ORGN        (optional and can be 0, multi-values) concentration of organic nitrogen in soil layers, g/kg
### SOL_ORGP        (optional and can be 0, multi-values) concentration of organic phosphorus in soil layers, g/kg
### SOL_SOLP        (optional and can be 0, multi-values) concentration of soluble phosphorus in soil layers, g/kg
